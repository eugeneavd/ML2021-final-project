In modern business, a need for targeted offers often appears. One of the most common tasks is sending messages to customers who wouldnâ€™t have purchased without this communication. Such problems need a specific approach that is uplift modeling. In this project, we consider the most popular uplift modeling techniques, such as the meta-learners and tree-based approaches. We compare several different classic machine learning models as well as neural networks for base models in meta-learners. Finally, we investigate the performance of the mentioned algorithms in different datasets, both real and synthesized.
